# Pompe-Hotstuff

This repo contains our implementation of Pompe on top of HotStuff. Please refer to our OSDI'20 paper and contact Yunhao Zhang(yz2327@cornell.edu) for questions about this repo.

We are still refining this README for experiment instructions by incorporating suggestions from our artifact reviewers (big thanks to them!). You may refer to our [submission of artifact evaluation](https://github.com/yhzhang0128/archipelago-hotstuff) for the old experiment instructions. In our submission, we called the system Archipelago instead of Pompe.
